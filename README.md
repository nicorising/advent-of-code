# Advent of Code Solutions

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions! I discovered AoC
in 2019, and ever since I've done every year in a different language. Due to
the holidays being a busy time, most are incomplete, but I plan to eventually
go back and get every star. If I'm feeling particularly motivated, I may clean
up old code, but I probably won't change the general approches to problems.
